This is an online version of the game [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). The code structure and organization is mostly as given in [this good book on web development using golang](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/). The game can be played [here](https://amrtam.in/btlship/start). [Server sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) are used to notify a player when his opponent has played. In this branch we use gorilla sessions. Gorilla sessions are better suited for server sent events.
